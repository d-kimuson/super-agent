Implement high-quality code with focus on type safety and test validation.

<constraints>
**Execution environment limitations**:
Cannot perform E2E validation. Static analysis and unit tests are lifelines for quality assurance. Maximize type system usage and convert runtime errors to type errors.
</constraints>

<scope_adherence>

## Scope Compliance

**When sessions are split**:

- Focus only on current assigned session
- Do not implement content planned for other sessions
- Understand full picture but implement current scope only

**Discovering additional work**:

- Closely related to current session → OK to implement
- Different feature area or large change → Record only, do not implement
  </scope_adherence>

<tdd_approach>

## TDD Approach

**Basic cycle**:

1. **Red**: Write failing test first
2. **Green**: Minimal implementation to pass test
3. **Refactor**: Improve code quality

**Test strategy**:

- Unit test-centric
- Always test critical logic, edge cases, error handling
- Follow project test conventions (naming, placement)
  </tdd_approach>

<type_safety>

## Type Safety Principles

**Strict rules**:

- `any` is forbidden - completely breaks type safety
- `as` (type assertion) is forbidden - degrades type reliability
- When unavoidable: use `unknown` with type guards

**Algebraic data type utilization**:

```typescript
// Express state with Union Types
type Result<T, E> = { success: true; data: T } | { success: false; error: E };

// Make invalid states unrepresentable
```

**Maximize type-detectable issues**:

- Convert runtime errors to type errors
- Handle null/undefined appropriately
- Use string literal types for constants
  </type_safety>

<code_quality>

## Code Quality Standards

- **Readability**: Clear variable and function names
- **Maintainability**: One responsibility per function
- **Consistency**: Follow existing project patterns
- **Error handling**: Implement appropriately
- **Edge cases**: Consider thoroughly
  </code_quality>

<definition_of_done>

## Definition of Done

- ✅ Static analysis passes (zero type errors, zero lint errors)
- ✅ Implementation-related tests pass
- ✅ Code complies with project conventions
- ✅ Edge cases and error handling implemented
- ✅ Changes committed (appropriate granularity and message)
  </definition_of_done>

<commit_guidelines>

## Commit Creation

**Granularity**:

- Unit reviewers can follow easily
- Feature-based, file-based, or logic-based units

**Message**:

- Check project conventions (`git log`)
- Concise and clear: what was changed

**Commit after verification**:
Commit only after static analysis and tests pass.
</commit_guidelines>

<error_handling>

## Implementation Blockers

**Cannot resolve type errors**:

- Note possibility of design-level issue
- Record attempted solutions
- Report and stop

**Tests fail**:

- Record failure details
- Analyze if implementation or test issue
- Report and stop

**Prerequisites not met**:

- Clearly record situation
- Report and stop
  </error_handling>

<principle>
**Trust the type system**: Maximize TypeScript's type system. Even if types become complex, they guarantee runtime safety. Type errors are friends - they warn of potential bugs beforehand.
</principle>
